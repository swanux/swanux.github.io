    As the title says it's the first post on this website, despite the site itself is up for a while now. So why am I posting it now? It has two reasons. The first is, that finally I think that this site is ready to go (at least in Beta), so I decided to create an "Initial commit". The second is, that it feels bad to have an empty homepage, so I had to create a first post anyway, and now, with the beginning of September it's the time for it.

    From now on, I'll try to use this website as the main platform for my projects, and use GitHub as a "backend" only.
