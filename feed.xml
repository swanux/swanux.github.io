  <p>
    I'm glad to finally announce my newest project: <strong>HTidal</strong>! If you would like to read more about it or view it on GitHub, you can visit the <a href="https://swanux.github.io/htidal.html">project page</a> of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    So let's talk about the release itself. It's the initial release of the program, so don't expect it to be completely stable and ready. It has nearly 100% functionality (home screen is missing) and I've tested it, so there shouldn't be serious bugs in it. If you encounter any problems, or you have any ideas then feel free to provide your <a href="https://swanux.github.io/feedbacks.html">feedback</a>.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    You can either download the DEB package or install it from <a href="https://swanux.github.io/hrepo.html">my APT repo</a>&nbsp;to get automatic updates.

    As the title says it's the first post on this website, despite the site itself is up for a while now. So why am I posting it now? It has two reasons. The first is, that finally I think that this site is ready to go (at least in Beta), so I decided to create an "Initial commit". The second is, that it feels bad to have an empty homepage, so I had to create a first post anyway, and now, with the beginning of September it's the time for it.
  </p>

  <p>
    From now on, I'll try to use this website as the main platform for my projects, and use GitHub as a "backend" only.
