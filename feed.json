The first is, that finally I think that this site is ready to go (at least in Beta), so I decided to create an \"Initial commit\". The second is, that it feels bad to have an empty homepage, so I had to create a first post anyway, and now, with the beginning of September it's the time for it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    From now on, I'll try to use this website as the main platform for my projects, and use GitHub as a \"backend\" only.\n  </p>",
